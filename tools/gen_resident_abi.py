"""Generate the sub-ROM's resident-ABI import (subrom-mathpack arc, spec §4).

Several sub-ROM PAGE-1 tenants call back into a fixed set of main-ROM
page-0-resident routines (fp_sqrt started this list, docs/spec-basic-subrom-
mathpack.md §4; sub/lineedit.asm's vars_reset call, docs/spec-eviction-g4-
space.md §4, is the newest addition). Their absolute addresses live in
build/basic-reloc.sym and SHIFT whenever the page-0 low region changes (any
edit to basic/float-arith.asm / basic/str-engine.asm / basic/input.asm /
basic/subromcall.asm / basic/arrays.asm, all assembled below $4000 in the
repack build). This tool re-extracts EXACTLY the routines the sub-ROM needs
from a fresh build/basic-reloc.sym and emits pasmo equates the sub-ROM build
includes — so a page-0-low shift can never leave a stale sub.rom calling
wrong addresses (the same class of stale-artifact trap as the old
$(MAIN_ROM) Makefile bug, see [[ips-rebuild-after-basic-change]]).

Fails loudly (nonzero exit) if:
  * any of the required symbols is missing from the reloc sym file, or
  * any of them resolves to $3FE5 (__MEAS_LOW_END) or above — i.e. it is
    NOT page-0-resident (< $4000), so a page-1 CALSLT could never reach it
    by absolute address (page 0 is switched OUT while the page-1 tenant
    runs — spec §2).
