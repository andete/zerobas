; graphics.asm — the SCREEN-2 geometry engine's page-0 sub-ROM island.
; Slice G1 (docs/spec-basic-graphics-g1.md): the VDP-access FLOOR + its
; interrupt-under-draw proof. No user-visible statement yet — G1 exists to build
; and *prove* the architecture every later slice (PSET/LINE/CIRCLE/PAINT/DRAW)
; rides on, before any feature does.
;
; WHY PAGE 0. This island is reached via subrom_call to SUBROM_IDX_GRAPHICS=8
; ($0028), which runs under the RAM interrupt trampoline (basic/subromcall.asm),
; so a tenant may EI and keep interrupts serviced through the paged-out BIOS. A
; long draw therefore does NOT starve H.TIMI/JIFFY — music keeps playing, exactly
; as it does on a real MSX (arc D1, docs/spec-basic-graphics.md §2). A page-0
; island has the BIOS switched out, so it CANNOT CALSLT WRTVRM — hence direct VDP
; port I/O (D2), which a pixel engine wants anyway (no CALSLT-per-byte).
;
; THE RACE IT CLOSES (D2/§3). Reading the VDP status port ($99), which the frame
; ISR does every VBLANK to ack the interrupt, RESETS the VDP address read/write
; latch flip-flop (published TMS9918A behaviour). If a VBLANK lands between the two
; $99 address-latch writes, the second write is taken as a fresh first byte → the
; address is wrong and the data byte lands in the wrong VRAM cell. gfx_vram_wr/rd
; therefore perform the whole address-setup + data transfer as ONE di-guarded unit
; (the same atomicity WRTVRM has), so no ISR can interleave the latch. The guard is
; a handful of T-states; the compute BETWEEN byte accesses stays fully interruptible.
;
; Clean-room: own-design. VDP ports + the status-read-resets-latch contract are the
; public TMS9918A hardware contract (called/observed, never a ROM disassembly —
; basic/PROVENANCE.md, [[no-reference-rom-disasm]]); the self-test, the guard
; discipline, and gfx_calc_addr are zerobas's own.

; --- G1 floor self-test VRAM window ----------------------------------------
; A block that is UNUSED by the display (and so never written by the cursor/ISR)
; in BOTH SCREEN 0 and SCREEN 1 — whichever the machine booted into — so a
; mismatch can only come from the latch race, never from a legitimate ISR VRAM
; write. SCREEN 0 uses $0000-$03BF (name) + $0800-$0FFF (font); SCREEN 1 uses
; $0000-$07FF (pattern) + $1800-$1AFF (name) + $2000-$27FF (colour). $2000-$3FFF
; is touched by neither's cursor/sprite path — safe headless scratch here.
GFX_ST_BASE     equ     $2000
GFX_ST_END      equ     $4000       ; one past the last cell (8 KB pass)

; ===========================================================================
; graphics_selftest — GFX_OP=0, the interrupt-under-draw gate body (index 8).
; Entered under DI by CALSLT. Proves BOTH architectural properties in one run:
;   * interrupts are SERVICED while drawing under EI  -> JIFFY delta >= 1
;   * the di-guarded latch keeps every VRAM access correct under those interrupts
;     -> a full write-then-read-back of an 8 KB block has ZERO mismatches.
; Writes f(addr)=low(addr) XOR high(addr) to every cell, then reads every cell
; back and counts cells != f(addr). Both passes run with interrupts LIVE, so ~8
; VBLANKs fire during them; with the guard, all land correctly (BAD=0); with the
; guard stripped (pasmo --equ GFX_UNGUARDED=1, the §4 teeth check) the racing ISR
; corrupts the latch and BAD>0 — proving this gate can actually fail.
; Results: GFX_DJ = JIFFY delta, GFX_BAD = mismatch count (basic/sysvars.inc).
