# Tier-2 STATE — resume here first

**This file is OVERWRITTEN, not appended.** It is the O(1) "where are we" board so a
new session doesn't have to re-read the 580-line audit log + do git archaeology.
History/provenance lives in [tier2-review-queue.md](tier2-review-queue.md); detail
specs are the `tier2-*.md` docs. Read this, then the one doc the next-action names.

_Last updated: 2026-07-01 — M13 (CONIN) DONE + validated; M14 OPEN. The M12 garbage-spin is
FIXED and CONIN works at the CHGET level; the next blocker is a NEW symptom (COMMAND.COM banner/
prompt lines don't render), not a CONIN regression. Detail below (Live thesis + Settled facts);
history in [tier2-review-queue.md](tier2-review-queue.md) M13._

## Goal
Boot MSX-DOS to the `A>` prompt under zerobas-disk (Tier-2) **without regressing
Tier-1** (disk-BASIC / BLOAD / FILES) and while staying a **BIOS-agnostic replacement
disk ROM** (works on CF-3300, C-BIOS, any standards MSX1). "Reached `A>`" means a
**visible** `A>` on screen + accepts a command — not just the right BDOS call sequence.

## Live thesis (M14 — CHARACTERISED 2026-07-01; HARD-STOP for sign-off before fix)
**The blocker is a BDOS func-9 (STROUT) OUTPUT gap, not a scroll/clear cosmetic.** Decisive
evidence (all via `disk_probe_diff.py`, test.dsk, anchored at COMMAND.COM `$0100`):
- `callseq --log 0x0005` → ours == stock **BYTE-IDENTICAL for all 18 BDOS calls** (STROUT×3,
  FOPEN, GDATE, CONOUT×12, BUFIN; same C/A/B/DE/HL/ret). COMMAND.COM's control flow is CORRECT —
  it issues every STROUT. This is the guardrail's gold-standard alignment.
- `callseq --log 0x00A2` (CHPUT, the shared bottleneck) → stock emits all 72 banner/prompt chars;
  **ours emits ONLY the 12 date chars** (`Sun 84-01-01`), which are the `C=02` CONOUT calls
  (n=5-16), reaching CHPUT via `ret=7934` = our `$5454` conout_body. Every `C=09` STROUT char is
  ABSENT from CHPUT on ours. `--log 0x5454` → ours 12 (date) / stock 0.
- `screen` (arbiter) → ours shows only `Sun 84-01-01` + the un-cleared BASIC power-on banner.
**⇒ func-2 CONOUT works on ours; func-9 STROUT emits ZERO chars.** Stock funnels all console output
through the kernel `$F392` path; ours vectors func-2 to disk-ROM `$5454` and loses func-9.
**This CORRECTS the M12 refutation** (see Dead ends): M12's "func-9 chars DO reach CHPUT" cited the
`ret=$7934` chars — but those are the func-2 DATE (`C=02`), not func-9 STROUT (`C=09`); a mislabel.
**LOCALISED (black-box, no kernel decode):** `--log 0xF392` → ours **0** / stock **90**; `--log 0x009C`
(CHSNS per-char break-poll on the output loop) → ours **0** / stock **72**. So ours' func-9 handler
dispatches but **never enters the char-output loop** — the `$F392` resident routine (CHSNS-poll + CHPUT)
is never reached. func-2 works via `$5454` (a different, wired path); func-9's output routine is
unreached/stubbed on ours (same shape as the old `$4462` FOPEN gap). Do NOT `trace` into `$F392`/
`$F2AC`/`$F237` (M12c reference-disasm hazard). Secondary symptom (separate): the BASIC banner isn't
cleared before the DOS sign-on. Detail: [tier2-review-queue.md](tier2-review-queue.md) M14 +
[tier2-m15-spec.md](tier2-m15-spec.md).

## Settled facts — DO NOT re-litigate or re-probe
- COMMAND.COM **loads AND reaches $0100** (handoff works); `$47B2` return contract done; `$0005`=`JP
  $D606` identical; `$F338`=0 DOS-handoff fix; GDATE @ `$553C` returns 1984-01-01 default; date path is
  byte-identical at BDOS level (n=1–18, no poke). (All prior COMMAND.COM-load / FOPEN-subset / date
  facts hold.)
- **M10 (still true):** `conout_body` ($5454 veneer) takes the char from **E** (the `$5454` contract),
  not A. The sign-on renders real ASCII because of this. DO NOT revert to reading A.
- **M13 (new, 2026-07-01): CONIN is implemented and working at the BDOS/CHGET level.** The `$50E0`
  veneer (`conin_line_body`) reaches CHGET once per char, matches stock's call count exactly (idle:
  1 call; with keys: N-chars+1), and the old infinite garbage spin is GONE — ours now holds a STABLE
  screen frame while blocked at CHGET, same as stock. Keystrokes echo correctly (reuses `conout_body`).
  DO NOT re-implement or second-guess this veneer without a concrete new probe result — the CHGET-count
  and no-spin evidence is decisive.
- **The sign-on (n=1–53) renders byte-correct on ours** (both reach CHPUT with identical chars).
- **STOCK's real boot = sign-on → `COMMAND version 1.08` → `Current date is Sun 84-01-01` →
  `Enter new date:` → blocks at BUFIN, now matched by ours at the CHGET level (M13).**

## Dead ends / refuted — do NOT re-walk
- **"There are TWO independent console-I/O bugs (func-9 output + BUFIN block)"** — REFUTED M12.
  ONE root cause (the missing CONIN line routine at `$50E0`, falling into `$5454` CONOUT) explained
  both; M13 fixed it.
- ~~**"func-9 STROUT emits ZERO chars / its `$F398` CONOUT vector is unset on ours"** — REFUTED M12.~~
  **RE-OPENED M14 (2026-07-01):** the M12 refutation mislabelled the func-2 DATE chars (`C=02`,
  `ret=$7934`) as "func-9 chars reaching CHPUT." With 18/18 dispatch alignment + the screen arbiter,
  func-9 STROUT genuinely emits ZERO chars on ours. This IS the M14 blocker (see Live thesis).
- **"The `Ø>@`/`D8 19 3E 40 0A` spam is a benign idle artifact / date-prompt cosmetics"** — REFUTED M11;
  root-caused M12 (CONIN→CONOUT fall-through); FIXED M13 (spin no longer occurs).
- **"conout_body should read the char from A"** — WRONG (that WAS the M10 bug). CONOUT contract is E.
- **"func-9 STROUT garbage is a page-0-swap clobbering the string read"** — REFUTED M11.1.
- **"A-2/int_h (keyboard interrupt service) is the CONIN blocker"** — REFUTED M12/M13: A-3/A-5 already
  chains KEYINT correctly; M13's keystroke-injection probes prove keys ARE received during CHGET.
- (Retained) older date-path dead ends: SDATE-is-next-blocker, FOPEN-return-value, register-only $0005
  intercept, M6 work-area pre-build, "skips MSXDOS.SYS init", "+2 clusters", "_GDATE is a clock bug",
  "init date cells alone", "the $80 render is a CHPUT-internal IX/IY/page-0 data divergence". All dead.

## Next action — M15: restore func-9 STROUT output (SPEC DRAFTED — AWAITING SIGN-OFF, no asm)
**M14 CHARACTERISED + LOCALISED (see Live thesis); spec = [tier2-m15-spec.md](tier2-m15-spec.md).**
The fix re-opens a refuted item and touches console-output wiring → sign-off before ANY asm.
1. **Localisation is DONE:** ours' func-9 handler dispatches but never enters the char-output loop
   (`$F392`=0, CHSNS `$009C`=0 vs stock 90/72). func-2 works via `$5454`; func-9's output routine is
   unreached/stubbed on ours (same shape as the `$4462` FOPEN gap).
2. **Remaining pin (spec §3, still no asm, clean-room-safe):** WHICH cell selects func-9's output —
   a work-area VECTOR (P-vector) or a missing RESIDENT routine (P-resident). Pin via a narrow,
   pointer-only `capture --mem` diff at the aligned func-9 dispatch (data cells only; NEVER read the
   `$F380-$F3A0` resident-code bytes = M12c hazard).
3. **Fix (spec §4, recommended (A)):** wire func-9's output to our own `conout_body` (`$5454`) — the
   same working routine func-2 uses. DOS-only + BIOS-agnostic; net-zero; no stock bytes.
4. **Arbiter:** `screen --machine ours` renders the 3 COMMAND.COM lines. Extend `disk_probe_diff.py`.
5. Secondary (defer): the un-cleared BASIC power-on banner. Separate cosmetic symptom.
6. Then drive to visible `A>` (inject a command + Enter once the prompt renders).

**One-command repros (test.dsk):**
- M14 evidence — dispatch identical, CHPUT diverges: `python3 probes/disk/disk_probe_diff.py callseq
  --at 0x0100 --log 0x0005 --maxhits 60 --diska ~/Documents/msx/msx/disks/test.dsk` (18/18 identical);
  swap `--log 0x00A2` (stock 72 / ours 12) to see the func-9 chars vanish downstream of dispatch.
- Screen arbiter: `python3 probes/disk/disk_probe_diff.py screen --machine both --settle 16
  --diska ~/Documents/msx/msx/disks/test.dsk` → ours shows only `Sun 84-01-01`, no STROUT literals.
- M13 regression (should still pass): `... callseq --at 0x0100 --log 0x009F --maxhits 12 ...` → 1 call.

## Method guardrails (DURABLE — keep these when you overwrite this file)
Endorsed 2026-06-27 after a retrospective found ~half the Tier-2 reframes came from
premature/misaligned conclusions, not hard bugs. See [[harness-first-investigation-mo]].
1. **Anchor + alignment.** Every differential capture is anchored on a SHARED logical event; PROVE
   both sides are at the same logical point before trusting a diff. (M11 win: the CHPUT stream is
   char-identical n=1–53, proving alignment, so the n=54 fork is REAL — and direct `screen` caught what
   40 calls of byte-identical BDOS trace hid. The M10 thesis was over-rosy precisely because it trusted
   a transient settle-12 render instead of observing the steady state.)
2. **Falsify first.** Step 1 of every milestone = the cheapest disproving experiment.
3. **Gate characterisation behind #2.** Don't map a full path until the cheap experiment confirms it.
4. **Right tool per question.** Settled facts → host unit-tests (`make unit-test`, no emulator);
   emulator only for emulator-dependent questions. **Observe the SIDE EFFECT directly** — `screen`
   (steady state, not a lucky early frame) is the arbiter for "what renders".
5. **Terse logging.** Full prose queue entry only for hard-stop forks; routine calls get a one-liner.

## Tooling — use the ONE harness, don't write a 58th probe
**`probes/disk/disk_probe_diff.py`** (on `omsx_session.py`) — the parameterized differential probe.
Modes: `callseq` (call-seq divergence + `--poke/--poke-reg`; prints the longer side's TAIL when one
blocks; logs `A`/`DE`/`B`/`ret`; `--keys/--keys-at` inject emulated keystrokes), `capture` (alignment-
guarded regs+mem diff at the Nth occurrence), `trace` (per-instruction PC fork + `--resync` + `--window`;
`--regdump REG` = aligned-PC register divergence walk; clean-room disasm guard: decodes only our own
code, PC>=0x4000, and auto-suppresses on the STOCK machine), **`screen`** (renders the VDP text screen
from VRAM — the arbiter that caught the M10 `$80` bug, the M11 garbage loop, and the M13 no-spin
confirmation; `--machine ours|stock|both`), and **`iowrite`** (VDP port byte-stream). **Extend this,
don't fork a script.** It copies the DOS disk to tmp (mutation-safe) and bakes in the alignment guard.
The 57 legacy `disk_probe_dosboot_*.py` were pruned 2026-06-30 (in git history if needed for provenance).

## Invariants for any change
- Tier-1 green: `make unit-test` 19/19; DSKIO/BLOAD/FILES == CF-3300.
- Net-zero: `disk.rom` == 16384 B; no canonical-address shifts.
- Probe machine = Philips_VG_8020 for bload-landmark; FILES runs on C-BIOS_MSX1_EU_BASIC_DISK.
- Clean-room: derive from DPB / public contracts / our own stubs; never copy stock bytes.
- Working mode = autonomous-span + [tier2-review-queue.md](tier2-review-queue.md); hard-stop
  on forks/irreversible/unresolvable.
