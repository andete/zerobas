; zerobas — main.asm
; ===========================================================================
; A clean-room, game-loader-scoped MSX1 BASIC, built as a standalone 16 KB
; cartridge ROM. See README.md and PROVENANCE.md.
;
; CLEAN-ROOM DISCIPLINE: every constant, address, and algorithm in this repo
; is traceable to an allowed source (MSX2 Technical Handbook, MSX Assembly
; Page, hardware datasheets, C-BIOS sources, or this project's own black-box
; oracle observations). Nothing is derived from an MSX-BASIC / GW-BASIC
; disassembly or a reference ROM disassembly. See PROVENANCE.md.
;
; Runtime model: this is an "AB" cartridge. The BIOS finds the header at $4000
; during boot and calls INIT. INIT never returns — it tokenises a line, the
; executor dispatches it, and the BLOAD handler hands off to the loaded binary.
; C-BIOS's CALBAS ($0159) is therefore never touched.
