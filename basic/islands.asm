; islands.asm -- BASIC code placed in C-BIOS's own alignment padding.
; ===========================================================================
; MAKING ROOM IN MAIN, lever B (TODO.md; Joost 2026-09-25: *"We need to come up
; with other ways to make room. Clearly reference fits everything in 32k"*, then
; *"B first, then A"*). C-BIOS pads to pinned addresses with `ds`; those runs
; are zero in OUR merged image, in the SAME slot as main, and always mapped with
; it. Each island below is one such run, confirmed in the C-BIOS source:
;   $1ACF..$1BBE  src/main.asm:3091 `ds $1bbf - $` -- pad up to the font
;   $0160..$01FF  src/main.asm:620  `ds $0200 - $` -- pad up to jump_table
; tools/split_islands.py cuts these bytes out of pasmo's image and
; tools/build_mainrom.py overlays them, REFUSING any byte outside those ranges or
; onto a non-zero C-BIOS byte.
; CLEAN-ROOM: original code (moved unchanged from basic/initext.asm). The two
; ranges come from the C-BIOS SOURCE -- a BSD-2 peer implementation this project
; already patches (cbios-repack/, docs/allowed-sources.md grade B) -- never from
; a reference ROM. No disassembly.
; ⚠️ WHAT MAY LIVE HERE: main code/data entered only by call/jp (no fallthrough
; in or out, no `jr` across the gap -- pasmo refuses those loudly), not imported
; by the sub-ROM or disk.rom ABIs, and not needed while page 0 is switched away
; from the main slot (a sub-ROM PAGE-0 tenant cannot reach it).
